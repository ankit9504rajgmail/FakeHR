**FakeHR** is a one-stop AI-powered tool designed to generate **realistic fake employee data** and **professional one-page resumes**.

Creating dummy data and resumes for testing HR tools is often time-consuming and lacks realism. FakeHR solves that with:

✅ **AI-generated resumes** (Google Gemini)  
✅ **Realistic employee datasets** with names, emails, job roles, etc.  
✅ **Bulk generation** with CSV, JSON, Excel & ZIP resume download  
✅ **User history tracking**  
✅ **Feedback & Ratings** system  
✅ **Mobile-friendly interface (Streamlit)**
